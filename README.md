# README

## Project Overview

This project visualizes the interaction between unemployment and average travel distance by incorporating spatial patterns. The data
visualization is done using a Dash web application, which displays a map, project details, and data sources.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- dash
- plotly
- pandas
- geopandas
- polars
- numpy

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file that sets up the Dash app, defines
  the layout, callbacks,and runs the server.
- `src/data/data_process.py`: Contains the `DataClean` class that
  handles data loading, cleaning, and processing.

## Data Sources

The data for this project comes from several sources:

- **LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics** ([LEHD](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES8/)): Data for origin and destination of people by census block.
- **Mobility, Opportunity, and Volatility Statistics**
  ([MOVS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/public-use-data/mobility-opportunity-volatility-statistics.html)): Average income by race and gender.
- **GENZ2018** ([GENZ2018](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/)): Shapes for the states to make the map.
- **TIGER2023** ([TIGER2023](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2023/TABBLOCK20/)): Shapes for the census block for each state.
- **Data Profile ACS 3-year estimates (DP03)**: Contains most control variables and variables used to create the MOVS dataset at the county level.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**
   The `DataClean` class in `data_process.py` handles the downloading,
   cleaning, and processing of the necessary data files. When instantiated, it will automatically load or download the required datasets.

2. **Running the App**
   To run the Dash app, execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:7050`.

### Application Layout

The app has three main tabs:

1. **Map Tab**: Displays a choropleth map showing the average travel distance by state.
2. **About Tab**: Provides an introduction to the project and details on the methodology.
3. **Data Tab**: Lists the data sources used in the project.

### Callbacks

The app includes callbacks to handle interactions:

- **Tab Navigation**: Updates the content based on the selected tab.
- **Year Slider**: Updates the map based on the selected year.

### Data Processing

The `DataClean` class processes the data in several steps:

1. **Load MOV Data**: Downloads and loads the MOVS data.
2. **Load Shape Data**: Downloads and loads the shape data.
3. **Load State Codes**: Loads or generates state codes.
4. **Load Blocks Data**: Downloads and processes the census blocks data.
5. **Load LODES Data**: Downloads and processes the LODES data.
6. **Create Graph Dataset**: Merges the LODES and shape data for graphing.

### Methodology

The project uses two regression models:

1. **OLS Regression**: Estimates coefficients of the MOVS dataset to move data from state level to county level.
2. **Panel Spatial Regression with Fixed Effects**: Incorporates spatial interaction between neighboring counties. The model used is:
   $$y_{it} = \rho \sum_{j=1}^N w_{ij} y_{jt} + x_{it} \beta + \mu_i + e_{it}$$
